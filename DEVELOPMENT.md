# AI-Assisted Development Process

## Overview
Prior to June 2025, this project was developed without AI assistance.
This document outlines how AI was used in developing it since.

## Key Development Areas

### Multi-Environment Support
- **Challenge**: Transform single-environment to multi-environment support
- **AI Assistance**: Code structure, file format design, backward compatibility
- **Human Decisions**: Choice of colon-separated format, conversion strategy

### Multi-Shell Implementation  
- **Challenge**: Port from Bash-only to Bash/Zsh/Fish
- **AI Assistance**: Shell-specific syntax, dispatcher pattern
- **Human Decisions**: Universal dispatcher approach, file structure

### Testing & Validation
- **Challenge**: Comprehensive test coverage for new features
- **AI Assistance**: Test case generation, edge case identification
- **Human Validation**: All tests run and verified manually

## Key Design Patterns Discussed
- Dispatcher pattern for shell detection
- Associative arrays vs parallel lists (Fish)
- Automatic format migration
